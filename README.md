# FullHybridDepthNet: Monocular Depth Estimation with Hybrid Architecture

## 1. Introduction
Accurate depth estimation from single images is a cornerstone challenge in computer vision, presenting a complex inverse problem where 3D geometric information must be inferred from 2D projections. *FullHybridDepthNet* introduces a novel, comprehensive architecture that synergistically combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and implicit neural representations to address this task.

The inherent difficulty of monocular depth estimation arises from its ill-posed natureâ€”multiple 3D scenes can map to the same 2D image, introducing ambiguities that require learned priors and contextual reasoning to resolve. Traditional methods, which often depend on geometric cues or hand-crafted features, struggle to capture the rich, contextual relationships essential for precise depth inference. FullHybridDepthNet overcomes these limitations through innovative design choices.

## 1.1. Motivation
The push for robust monocular depth estimation is fueled by both technical challenges and practical applications. Our work is driven by the following:

### 1.1.1. Technical Challenges
- **Scale Ambiguity**: Depth estimation from a single view lacks inherent scale, necessitating advanced normalization and learning techniques.
- **Domain Adaptation**: Variations between training and real-world environments demand resilient feature extraction.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Real-time applications require a balance of accuracy and speed, especially on resource-limited devices.

### 1.1.2. Architectural Innovations
FullHybridDepthNet introduces several key advancements:
1. **Hybrid Feature Extraction**
   - Combines CNN-based local feature extraction with Transformer-based global context modeling.
   - Employs a multi-scale feature pyramid network for hierarchical representation.
   - Uses adaptive attention mechanisms for context-aware feature aggregation.
2. **Implicit Depth Refinement**
   - Leverages neural implicit functions for continuous depth representation.
   - Includes learnable refinement modules to preserve edges.
   - Applies gradient-based optimization for structural consistency.
3. **Multi-Modal Learning Framework**
   - Utilizes contrastive learning for robust feature representations.
   - Incorporates cross-modal attention mechanisms.
   - Enforces geometric consistency via multi-view supervision.

           self.transformer_attention = TransformerAttention(dim, heads)
           self.fusion = AdaptiveFusion(dim)
           
       def forward(self, x):
           conv_features = self.conv_attention(x)
           transformer_features = self.transformer_attention(x)
           return self.fusion(conv_features, transformer_features)
